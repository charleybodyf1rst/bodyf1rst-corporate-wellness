## Common Objections & Responses

**"We value the WebMD connection"**
> "WebMD content is information, not transformation. Employees can Google health content - what they can't get is personalized AI coaching that adapts to their specific goals. Content is commodity; coaching is competitive advantage."

**"We're focused on culture, not fitness"**
> "Healthy employees create better culture. Research shows physically active employees are 15% more productive and 25% less likely to leave. We deliver culture impact THROUGH wellness outcomes."

**"We like their listening tools"**
> "Survey data tells you what employees think. Our engagement data shows what they actually DO. Action beats sentiment. Plus, our HR dashboard provides the insights you need without a separate survey platform."

5. "Can we get a pilot program before committing?" (They don't offer one)

- **$0 setup fee** vs $500-$1K+
- **30-60 day pilots** available (they don't offer)
