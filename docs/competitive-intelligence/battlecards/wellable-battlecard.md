## Common Objections & Responses

**"We like the low price"**
> "What's your price after adding SSO, HRIS integration, and premium analytics? Our $10/month includes everything - when you add up their add-ons, we're comparable but with AI coaching, full mobile app, and live coaching options."

**"We just need challenges"**
> "Challenges alone show 40% lower outcomes than personalized coaching. What happens when the novelty of challenges wears off? Our AI coaching keeps employees engaged long-term."

**"We can manage it ourselves"**
> "Great - so can our customers. We're equally self-service, but with AI that manages personalization automatically. Less work for your HR team, better results for employees."
