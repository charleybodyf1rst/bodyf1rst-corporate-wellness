## Common Objections & Responses

**"We want gym access as a benefit"**
> "Great for the 15% who use gyms - but what about the other 85% of your workforce? Digital-first wellness reaches everyone, including remote workers, home-based employees, and people who don't like gyms."

**"Employees love having gym options"**
> "Do they? What's your actual utilization rate? Most companies see 15-20% of employees use gym benefits. Our customers see 85%+ engagement because we meet employees where they are."

**"It's free for the company"**
> "Nothing is 'free' - either you subsidize it or employees pay. Either way, you're investing in something only 15% use. Same budget with BodyF1RST reaches your entire workforce with personalized coaching."

## Deal Acceleration Tactics

2. **Show remote worker solution** - They can't match this
3. **Demo team challenges** - Feature they don't have
4. **Calculate per-engaged-employee cost** - Gympass is more expensive

## Red Flags (Watch for These)

- Fitness-focused company culture (gym enthusiasts)
- Near urban gym network
- CEO/executives are gym enthusiasts
- Just signed Wellhub contract
