## Sales Intelligence

### Typical Deal Size
- **Range**: $0 - $100,000 annual (highly variable)
- **Average**: Depends on subsidy model
- **True Cost**: Often hidden in employee payroll

### Sales Cycle
- **Duration**: 1-2 months
- **Stages**: Demo > Proposal > Implementation
- **Complexity**: Low

### Decision Makers
1. **Primary**: HR Director, Benefits Manager
2. **Secondary**: CFO (if employer-subsidized)
3. **Influencer**: Employees (requesting gym access)

### Common Objections

| Objection | Counter |
|-----------|---------|
| "We want gym access as a benefit" | Great for 15% who use gyms; what about the other 85%? |
| "Employees love having gym options" | Engaged employees prefer personalized coaching + gym option |
| "It's free for the company" | Nothing is free - low engagement means wasted benefit spend |
| "It's an easy benefit to offer" | Easy doesn't mean effective; wellness ROI matters |

### Killer Questions for Prospects
1. "What percentage of employees actually use the gym benefit?"
2. "How do you engage employees who don't go to gyms?"
3. "What team wellness challenges does Wellhub offer?"
4. "How do remote workers participate in your wellness program?"
