## The "Single Purpose" Problem

### Headspace's Limitation
Meditation and mental health content only - a point solution, not a platform.

### Real-World Impact
- Companies need 2-3 vendors for complete wellness
- Administrative overhead multiplies
- Employee experience fragmented
- ROI harder to measure across vendors

### Industry Data
- 73% of companies prefer unified wellness platforms
- Mental health outcomes improve 40% when combined with physical fitness
- Exercise is proven to reduce anxiety and depression
- Holistic programs show 2.5x higher sustained engagement

### BodyF1RST Positioning
> "Why pay for mental health only when you can get mental health + fitness + nutrition + AI coaching for the same price?"

## Price/Value Comparison

### Scenario: 500 Employees

#### Headspace Enterprise
| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| 500 employees x $156/yr | $78,000/yr |
| Features | Meditation only |
| What's missing | Fitness, nutrition, coaching, challenges |

#### Headspace + Fitness Vendor
| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Headspace | $78,000/yr |
| Fitness platform (estimated) | $60,000/yr |
| **Total** | **$138,000/yr** |
| Still missing | AI coaching, nutrition |

#### BodyF1RST Standard
| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| 500 employees x $180/yr | $90,000/yr |
| Features | Everything included |
